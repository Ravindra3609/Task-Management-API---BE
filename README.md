This Task Management API is designed to streamline team collaboration and efficient task management by providing robust features like task prioritization, deadline management, and team-based access control. Through this API, users can create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks, each with attributes such as title, description, priority, due date, and assigned collaborators. The system also supports task dependencies, ensuring tasks with dependencies are only marked complete once their prerequisite tasks are done. Advanced querying, filtering, and sorting capabilities allow users to find specific tasks based on priority, due date, status, and assigned users or teams. Moreover, role-based access control (RBAC) is built-in, enabling structured team collaboration with Owner, Admin, and Member roles that define each userâ€™s permissions within a team.

To enhance user experience, this API includes real-time task updates powered by WebSocket, keeping users informed of changes like task status updates and new assignments without refreshing. Recurring tasks are also supported, allowing users to create repeat tasks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. To keep users aware of impending deadlines, the API uses a background service to trigger notifications for overdue or soon-to-be-due tasks, with notifications sent to all assigned team members. Security is enforced through JWT-based authentication, ensuring only authorized access, while all data, including task history, is securely stored in MongoDB, allowing users to track changes made over time.
